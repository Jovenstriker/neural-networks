## ActualMNISTNN.ipynb
MNIST dataset project. Created Convolutional Neural Network CNN from scratch, implemented activation functions, forward propagation, backpropagation. Found 89% accuracy

## RNN.ipynb
Created a Recurrent Neural Network. Used to predict stock tickers and future outputs of trigonmetric sequences

## LSTM.ipynb
Created a Long Short-Term Memory Network. Used to predict stock tickers and future outputs of trigonmetric sequences

## QuadRegressionAIModel.ipynb
Created very simple one layer quadratic regression model that finds the coefficients of ax^2 + bx + c with gradient descent. Also done with linear regression
